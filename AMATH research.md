### foundational algorithm 

[[QR Decomposition]]
[[thin QR decomposition]] & (rectangular(tall skinny case))

Note: thin QR gives a projection method onto the range of a matrix 

lowrank approximation via column pivoted - QR decomp (CPQR)

applications
low rank - motivated by applications and domain spaces

two types of papers
application - low-rank: integral equations (domain with a pde in it) greens theorem (blob into 1d domain of integration), kernel functions(not just svm style - reductionality principles)
math - focus on the theory method but for what?

tall skinny matrix - faster than svd for low rank approx. 

speed order - LU - QR - SVD: same computational complexity but the speed difference matters
